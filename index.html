        <p>
          Sheepy is a lucky sheep, he has 3 lives! Your task is to get him home
          safe by using your keyboard. First of all, beware of wolves! They take
          one life out of Sheepy everytime they touch him. But Sheepy is no
          ordinary sheep: he learned kungg-fu! Get rid of ennemies and udpate
          his victory score by jumping on them. On his way home, Sheepy also has
          to overcome perillous pits. Beware of those, because they will take
          Shippy away forever.
