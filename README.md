# Sheepy Run


Sheepy Run is the first project I had the chance to develop during the 9 weeks IronHack bootcamp.
The goal was to build a working video game in 4 days using what we had learned during the first 2 weeks of the bootcamp. I chose a side-scrolling game and decided to use Canvas to expand my knowledge of animation and understand how games likes Super Mario are built.
